Titanic EDA Project
This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, where we analyze the characteristics of passengers and identify factors that contributed to survival.and fitting the best model to predict the titanic passengers survival 
by training and evaluating two classifier models on the dataset(ligistice Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour classifier)

Overview
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and data preprocessing.
Exploratory Analysis: Visualizing features such as age, gender, passenger class, etc.
Statistical Insights: Analyzing correlations and survival rates.

Result:
Accuracy of the KNN model is less than that of Logistic model.therefore,Logistic model is the best classification model for this dataset
